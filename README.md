# DELI-cious-

# My Project overview

============================

For this application the customer at a local deli shop wanted to start incorparting online orders for there business. I made an application that lets the customer make their sandwich based on the menu options. Also let's them get a drink, chips and at the end gives them a total receipt. A file is printed with the copy of the receipt after the order is completed.
